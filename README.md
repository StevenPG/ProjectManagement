# ProjectManagement

The Project Management App is a social application that allows the user to track the progress of a project. The app will generally be used by college students to help with the dreadful group projects. In addition, the application allows the authorized user to add members and to keep track of the percentage of completion of the project. The user who creates the project is automatically assigned the leader role; which entitles the user the power to add and or delete members of the project. Once a project is created, each member is added by the leader.

Designed as the keystone project for our degree program, we completed this application during an alotted two-semester time frame before giving a final presentation in April 2016.
