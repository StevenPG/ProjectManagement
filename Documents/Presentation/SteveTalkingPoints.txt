Short Version:
- When we started, we needed a way to communicate b/t server and client. Writing requests from scratch was a hassle.
- Created library to easily pass data from client to server. Lib has bunch of obj that mirror database areas.
- Heavily used polymorphism for tables. Only wrote one version of code that all table entry types work with.
- Lib designed so we could build objects w/ relevant data, and ask object to send a request built from data objects.
- Sped up dev time on client, allowed for quick and easy database calls.

- Server side written in Python, using micro-framework Flask and Tornado.
- Ran into a problem late in semester, Flask could only field so many requests. 
- Started crashing it when multiple people used App.
- Fixed this by putting the web service inside a python app server called Tornado.
- Having app server allows for more requests handled by Tornado rather than Flask.
- Chose to use SQLite3 as our database and used Python's built-in sqlite3 lib

- Ran into same problem on server as on client, database calls were a hassle from scratch.
- Wrote an abstraction tool to make the calls easier and only one line of code
- Back end dev work went smoother as pre-created requests came out of client into server, and server used abstraction tool to make database calls.
